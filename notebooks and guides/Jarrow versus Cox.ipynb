    "# Comparing approaches to volatiltiy:\n",
    "In one of the other notebooks I stated that Jarrow-Rudd approach will have the pseudo-probabililty approach 50/50. Additionally I said that Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model performs poorly for larger time intervals or smaller volatilties. But what's the best way to quickly demonstrate those statements? Here I think this through. \n",

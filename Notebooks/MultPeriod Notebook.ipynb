    "Here's why. The single period binomial pricing model accurately prices an option for an *arbitrary* period of time. Notice that at no point in my code do I ask for a time to expiration date. One would assume that this was because the code could only be used for 1 year time periods. In fact, this is not the case. Additionally, the risk-free rate is *not* denoted as an annual risk-free rate but instead as simply, the risk free rate. Lastly, did you notice that each class has an override ability? By default, the code assumes it can calculate the payoffs from the difference in the strike price and the up and down values. So one would think you never need to override the payoffs.

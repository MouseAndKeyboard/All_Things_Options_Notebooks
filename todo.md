# To do list:
* Begin packing black-scholes model into it's own class. Add greeks
* separate out the functionality of the binomial options. (have one class that solves using up and down values, another class that solves using volatility, and one that solves when passed payoff states. All of these will be for 1 period calculation which are the smallest 'unit' in the system.)

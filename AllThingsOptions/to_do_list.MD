# To do list 
* Update Single Period Binomial Pricing so that it makes it obvious that the risk-free rate is a continous compounding value.
* Finish Multi-period Binomial Pricing....
* In the single peirod pricing module, need to include user control. Currently doesn't handle lower case. Also doesn't generate an informative error when passing the wrong type. Passing a string that isn't `'Call'` or `'Put'` throws a non discript error...
* Begin working on the easy documentation
* Work on user notebook guide to `options.py`

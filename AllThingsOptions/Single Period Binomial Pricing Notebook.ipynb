    "# Refresher on Binomial Pricing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping right into the Black-Scholes model I believe that it's important to describe what is going on under the hood. This can be done by first exploring the binomial pricing model for its simplicity in roughly describing what the Black-Scholes better achieves.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why explore this? \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most rudimentary option pricing model out there. It seeks to measure the price of an option by describing its characteristics using only two different payoff states each with their own probability of occuring. More on that in a bit. In short the binomial pricing model is useful in demonstrating how to approximate an option price, how to calculate risk-neutral probabilities, and illustrates the logic needed in approximating solutions where no explicit analytical solution exists (like for American Puts).\n",
    "### A note:\n",
    "The main example I will be using can be found in *An Introduction to Derivative Securities, Financial Markets, and Risk Management* by Robert Jarrow and Arkadev Chatterjea. I'm not going to show the binomial tree diagrams (that might change in the future). If you are a visual learner I highly recommend you attempt to draw your own to build familiarity. [Here](https://xplaind.com/552187/binomial-options-pricing-model) is a short guide showing how the numerical values interact. Additionally,  Investopedia is a good place to start as they show how to visualize multi-period binomial tree diagrams in Excel which can be found [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/binomialoptionpricing.asp).

    "You go to look up Your Beloved Machine Inc (YBM) stock price and find it sitting exactly at `$100`. Suppose you have an accurate but broken crystal ball that lets you see two different futures 1 year from now with their own discrete probabilites of occuring (don't ask why...). In one future you see the stock price rise to `$120` and your crystal ball says that the probability of this happening is `3/4` chance. In the other future you see the stock price drop to `$90.25` with a probaiblity of `1/4`. You know for certain it will be one or the other. According to the crystal ball one of these realities must occur. If its not `$120` then it will be `$90.25` It can't be any other number. Let's refer to these as the `up` and `down` states.\n",

In addition, you know the risk-free rate is 5.13% (wow, what a rate!). Now you are an intelligent investor and want to make sure you are getting a good deal. The trouble is, you have no idea if the premium  for the option is a resonable price! The more you think about it, the more you wonder how a person comes up with this price. So you open up your derivatives textbook and get to work figuring out how to calculate the price on your own.\n",

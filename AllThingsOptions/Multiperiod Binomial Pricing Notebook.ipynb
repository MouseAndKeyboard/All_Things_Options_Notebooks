    "In the Binomial Pricing model notebook I used `5.13%` as the annual risk-free rate. Where did that number come from? It comes from $e^{0.05}$ which equals `1.051271`... which is pretty much `5.13%` return. Very sneaky. But this will save headache later when working with smaller time frames. I'll update the binomial pricing code to reflect that in the main release.\n",
